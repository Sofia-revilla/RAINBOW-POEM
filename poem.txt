The Rainbow and the Unicorn

Red
Orange
Yellow
Green
Indigo
Blue
Unicorn
Violet

These colors appear right after the rain,
it somehow always reminds me of being with you some day,
every time their soft hues start to flow,
I just know that you're the real treasure at the end of the rainbow <3
And the unicorn
